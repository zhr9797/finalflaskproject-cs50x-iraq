 CS50 Final Project

My Final Project for CS50 is a simple website using flask, python, and SQL.
The website named CODE FOR KIDS, it's a website where the kids can experience a different way to learn to program and make their own project.
as well, the website will give the children courses that will increase their logical thinking to a better understanding of programming.
finally, the kid's account will be under parent control to make the website more secure for the children.
